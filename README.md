# The-Mavity-Tree
simple game application using Java and JavaFX
Our team comprised of three aspiring undergraduate computer science students bulit a simple, streamable and interactable game which revolves arounf the basic idea of players gaining points depending on their luck. We used Java and JavaFX libraries to build this game.
The word "Mavity" comes from the sarcasm of the reknowned series, Doctor Who, where when Newton discovers gravity there is a different name given to it which is Mavity!!
There is a help bar where players can see the rules about the game.
The game itself is ver simple. Let me break it down for you:
1) When you start the game you are directed to our very own spinwheel where the player is given initial points.
2) then the game takes you to a second spinwheel where the player is assigned specific number of drops
3) then the game takes the player to our very own mavity tree where there are numbered apples an dthe players can decide which apples to drop but wait!!!! not so fast, there's a catch, there is  Poison Apple in the tree which ends the game immediatelyand the player looses.
4) another detail to note is there are two types of apples; sweet and sour , sweet apples adds to players points, whereas sour apples deducts the score
5) finally don't miss the unique animations at the end of the game.
